# Host a Website on EC2 Linux Instance Using Apache

This guide walks you through the process of hosting a static website on an **Amazon EC2 instance** running **Amazon Linux 2**. The website will be served using the **Apache HTTP server**.

## **Description**

In this project, you'll launch an **EC2 instance** with **Amazon Linux 2**, install **Apache HTTP server**, and deploy a simple static website (HTML files). The website will be accessible through the public IP address or a custom domain name if desired.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

1. **AWS Account**: You need an active AWS account to create EC2 instances and use other AWS services.
2. **IAM User Permissions**: Your IAM user should have sufficient permissions to create EC2 instances, configure security groups, and manage related resources.
3. **SSH Key Pair**: You need an SSH key pair for secure access to your EC2 instance.
4. **A Web Browser**: You'll need a browser to test your website by accessing the EC2 public IP.
5. **Basic Linux and SSH Knowledge**: Comfort with terminal commands to interact with your EC2 instance.

## **Steps**

### 1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in.
2. **Navigate to EC2**: In the console, search for and select **EC2**.
3. **Launch Instance**: 
    - Click **Launch Instance**.
    - **Choose an AMI**: Select **Amazon Linux 2 AMI** (Amazon Linux 2 is the default for EC2).
    - **Choose Instance Type**: Select a free tier-eligible instance type like **t2.micro**.
    - **Configure Instance**: Use the default configuration or customize based on your needs.
    - **Configure Security Group**:
        - Add a rule to allow **HTTP (Port 80)** for web traffic.
        - Add a rule for **SSH (Port 22)** for secure access (limit to your IP for security).
    - **Review and Launch**: Review your settings and click **Launch**.

### 2. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance via SSH**

After your EC2 instance is running, you can connect to it using SSH:

1. **Find the Public IP**: Go to the **Instances** page in EC2 and locate your instance. Copy the **Public IP** address.
2. **SSH into the Instance**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Run the following command to connect to your EC2 instance (replace `<your-key.pem>` with your private key and `<ec2-public-ip>` with your EC2 public IP):
     ```bash
     ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>
     ```
   - Accept the SSH fingerprint if prompted to establish a secure connection.

### 3. **Install Apache Web Server**

Once you're connected to your EC2 instance, you'll need to install the **Apache HTTP server**.

1. **Update the System**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

2. **Install Apache**:
   - To install the **Apache HTTP server**, use the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install httpd -y
     ```

### 4. **Start Apache Web Server**

After installation, start the Apache service and enable it to automatically start on boot.

1. **Start Apache**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start httpd
   ```

2. **Enable Apache to Start on Boot**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable httpd
   ```

### 5. **Verify Apache Installation**

To verify that Apache is working:

1. **Check Apache Status**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status httpd
   ```
   The output should show that the **Apache** service is active (running).

2. **Access the Website**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to the **Public IP** of your EC2 instance:
     ```
     http://<ec2-public-ip>
     ```
   - You should see the default Apache test page, indicating that Apache is installed and running.

### 6. **Deploy Your Website Files**

Now that Apache is set up, it’s time to deploy your website’s files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, etc.).

1. **Upload Website Files to the Server**:
   - You can use **SCP** (Secure Copy) to upload your website files to the EC2 instance. For example:
     ```bash
     scp -i /path/to/your-key.pem index.html ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>:/var/www/html/
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can create the files directly on the EC2 instance using a text editor like `nano` or `vi`.

2. **Move Files to the Correct Directory**:
   By default, Apache serves content from `/var/www/html/`. Ensure your `index.html` and other web files are in this directory:
   ```bash
   sudo mv /path/to/your/index.html /var/www/html/
   ```

3. **Ensure Proper Permissions**:
   Apache must have permission to read the files. Set the correct ownership and permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/*
   ```

### 7. **Configure the Security Group**

To allow access to your website, make sure your EC2 instance’s security group is configured correctly.

1. **Edit Security Group**:
   - Go to **EC2 Console > Security Groups**.
   - Select the security group associated with your EC2 instance.
   - Ensure there’s an inbound rule allowing **HTTP (Port 80)** from **0.0.0.0/0** (for public access) or your IP range.
   - If you don’t already have this rule, add the following:
     - **Type**: HTTP
     - **Port Range**: 80
     - **Source**: 0.0.0.0/0 (or a specific IP range)

### 8. **Access the Website**

Now that the files are deployed and the server is configured, open a browser and go to the **Public IP** of your EC2 instance:
```
http://<ec2-public-ip>
```
You should see your website in the browser!

### 9. **Optional: Set Up a Domain Name**

If you have a domain name and want to map it to your EC2 instance:

1. **Allocate an Elastic IP**: 
   - In the EC2 console, allocate an **Elastic IP** and associate it with your EC2 instance.
   
2. **Update DNS Settings**: 
   - Log into your domain registrar’s control panel.
   - Set the **A Record** for your domain to point to your Elastic IP.
   - Propagation may take some time (typically up to 24 hours).

### 10. **Stop/Restart Apache Web Server (Optional)**

1. **To stop Apache**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop httpd
   ```

2. **To restart Apache** (for changes like configuration updates):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```
